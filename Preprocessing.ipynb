Omega JYM is our exclusive fish oil supplement specifically formulated to deliver the proper dose of two critical omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. Because Omega JYM delivers the proper dose of each fat, rather than skimping on one, it really is the alpha of omegas. While several fish oils provide a decent amount of EPA, no other omega-3 product comes close to delivering as much DHA per serving as Omega JYM. That\\u2019s unfortunate since DHA, or docosahexaenoic acid, is a critical omega-3 fat. In fact, the proper dose of DHA?in conjunction with EPA?is essential if you want to reap any of the amazing benefits omega-3 fats can deliver. For those who train, nothing is more exciting than current research suggesting fish oil may help spur muscle growth when the proper dose of DHA is supplied, that is. That proper dose appears to be 1500 mg of DHA per day with an equivalent dose of EPA, or eicosapentaenoic acid. Each serving of Omega JYM provides: 4 grams of pure, molecularly distilled fish oil 1500 mg DHA 1500 mg EPA What Sets It Apart: The problem with most fish oil and omega-3 products on the market today is that they grossly under dose DHA, or they keep the dose of DHA proprietary so you don\\u2019t know how much you\\u2019re getting. Omega-3 supplements that don\\u2019t list the dose of DHA are problematic because you never know if you\\u2019re getting enough of this critical omega-3 fat. Taking an omega-3 supplement that provides a low dose of DHA means that you have to take a handful of capsules to get the proper daily dose. We formulated Omega JYM to provide you 375 mg of DHA and EPA per capsule. That means you only need to take four Omega JYM capsules per day to get 1500 mg of DHA and EPA. That totals just 5 grams of fat per day. Few?if any?other fish oil supplements provide that much DHA per capsule.[\\\"Quality Ingredients - Omega JYM is a high-potency fish oil supplement. These high strength pills are specifically formulated to deliver the best: 1500 mg of DHA, 1500 mg of EPA, and 300 mg of DPA. With all 3 fats, Omega JYM really is the alpha of omegas.\\\", \\\"Body Composition - Supplemental omega 3 fatty acids such as EPA and DPA have been shown to optimize lean body mass relative fat mass in healthy adults. These fatty acids are believe to play a positive role in reducing adiposity relative to lean muscle.\\\", \\\"Growth & Support - These omega oils have 1500MG OF DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid). For exercisers, nothing is more exciting than current research suggesting that this fish oil may also help support training goals.\\\", \\\"Health Benefits - EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid) is powerful in supporting important vital health throughout our lifetime including healthy brain and joint function.\\\", \\\"No Burps - Say goodbye to the dreaded \\\\\\\"fish-oil burps.\\\\\\\" These tablets are burpless since the omega goes through molecular distillation that results in less odor and taste, Omega JYM is one of the purest and more potent fish oil supplements on the market.\\\"]{\\\"section_1\\\": \\\"Safety Information\\\\nThis product is labelled to United States standards and may differ from similar products sold elsewhere in its ingredients, labeling and allergen warnings\\\", \\\"section_2\\\": \\\"Ingredients\\\\nTotal Fish Oil 2,800 mg EPA (Eicosapentaenoic acid) Omega-3 750 mg DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid) Omega-3 750 mg DPA (Docosapentaenoic acid) Omega-3 150 mg\\\", \\\"section_3\\\": \\\"Legal Disclaimer\\\\nThese statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
